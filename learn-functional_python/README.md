# Can Python code be made functional?

This is the central question i seek to answer in these series of experiements.

## Motivation

In my limited experience with functional programming I'm convinced that the many benefits - automatic code generation, abstractions that are easy to reason about, etc - outweigh the costs - learning a whole new way to think about coding.
